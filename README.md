## 📊 Progression System

### Leveling & Experience
- **5 Levels** with increasing health (1000 + 150 per level). The Scythe and Runeblade increase their maximum mana pool per level, while the Greatsword, Sabres, and Bow instead gain increased critical strike chance and critical strike damage per level.
- **EXP Requirements**: 50 → 100 → 200 → 400 total XP to level up. Enemy Player Kills reward 10 EXP, while the Enemy's Summoned Unit kills are worth 5 EXP each. Clearing the wave of Summoned Units before your opponent rewards an additional 10 EXP. 
- **Combat Rewards**: Players and their summoned unit kills grant experience points.
- **Skill Points**: 1 point per level + 2 starting points

### Ability Unlocking
- **4 Abilities per Weapon**: {Q} unlocked by default, {E}, {R}, {F} active hotkeys and a passive ability choice {P}
- **Strategic Choices**: Mix and match abilities across weapon slots

## 🏗️ Entity Component System (ECS) Architecture

### Core ECS Classes

#### **Entity** (`Entity.ts`)
- **Unique Identification**: Each entity has a unique auto-incrementing ID
- **Component Container**: Map-based storage of components with type-safe access
- **Component Queries**: Efficient checking for required component combinations
- **Lifecycle Management**: Active/inactive states and cleanup callbacks
- **User Data**: Arbitrary data storage for game-specific information

```typescript
const player = world.createEntity();
player.addComponent(new Transform(new Vector3(0, 0, 0)));
player.addComponent(new Movement(3.75, 0.8)); // speed, friction
player.addComponent(new Health(1000));
```

#### **Component** (`Component.ts`)
- **Abstract Base Class**: All components inherit from `Component`
- **Reset Method**: Required for object pooling cleanup
- **Enabled Flag**: Runtime component activation/deactivation
- **Explicit Type Identifiers**: String-based component identification for performance

#### **System** (`System.ts`)
- **Component Requirements**: Array of required component types for entity filtering
- **Priority System**: Lower numbers execute first (0-100 range)
- **Lifecycle Callbacks**: `onEntityAdded`, `onEntityRemoved`, `onEnable`, `onDisable`
- **Specialized Subclasses**: `RenderSystem`, `PhysicsSystem` for different update types

#### **World** (`World.ts`)
- **Entity Registry**: Central management of all entities
- **System Orchestration**: Priority-sorted system execution
- **Component Pooling**: Automatic object pooling for performance
- **Event System**: Inter-system communication
- **Query System**: Efficient entity filtering by component combinations

```typescript
const world = new World();

// Add systems in priority order
world.addSystem(new MovementSystem(inputManager)); // priority 10
world.addSystem(new CollisionSystem());           // priority 20
world.addSystem(new CombatSystem(world));         // priority 30

// Main game loop
world.update(deltaTime);
world.fixedUpdate(fixedDeltaTime);
world.render(deltaTime);
```

### Component Types

#### **Core Components**
- **Transform**: Position, rotation, scale with matrix caching and parent-child hierarchies
- **Movement**: Physics simulation with velocity, acceleration, friction, and movement flags
- **Health**: Damage/healing system with regeneration, invulnerability, and death states
- **Shield**: Damage absorption with regeneration mechanics

#### **Gameplay Components**
- **Enemy**: AI behavior, target tracking, and enemy-specific properties
- **Projectile**: Bullet/projectile simulation with lifetime and collision detection
- **Tower**: Defensive structures with health and ownership
- **Pillar**: Destructible map objectives with health tracking
- **SummonedUnit**: Temporary allied units with ownership and targeting

#### **Rendering Components**
- **Renderer**: Visual representation with material and geometry management
- **HealthBar**: UI health display with dynamic positioning
- **Collider**: Collision detection shapes and boundaries

### System Architecture

#### **Update Systems**
- **MovementSystem**: WASD input, physics simulation, dash mechanics
- **CombatSystem**: Damage calculation, healing, death handling
- **ControlSystem**: Player input, weapon switching, ability management
- **CollisionSystem**: Spatial hash collision detection
- **AudioSystem**: Spatial audio positioning and playback

#### **Render Systems**
- **RenderSystem**: Three.js rendering with LOD management
- **CameraSystem**: Dynamic camera positioning and smoothing
- **HealthBarSystem**: Health bar positioning and updates

#### **Physics Systems** (Fixed Timestep)
- **PhysicsSystem**: Fixed-timestep physics simulation for consistency

### Performance Optimizations

#### **Component Pooling**
```typescript
// World automatically pools components for reuse
const transform = world.createComponent(Transform); // Reused from pool
world.returnComponent(transform); // Returned to pool for next use
```

#### **Entity Queries**
```typescript
// Query entities with specific component combinations
const enemies = world.queryEntities([Transform, Movement, Enemy]);
const projectiles = world.queryEntities([Transform, Projectile]);
```

#### **System Matching**
```typescript
// Systems only process entities with required components
class MovementSystem extends System {
  readonly requiredComponents = [Transform, Movement];

  update(entities: Entity[], deltaTime: number) {
    // Only entities with Transform AND Movement components
    entities.forEach(entity => { /* process */ });
  }
}
```

#### **Event-Driven Communication**
```typescript
// Systems communicate through world events
world.emitEvent('player_damaged', { playerId, damage, source });
world.emitEvent('enemy_killed', { enemyId, killerId });

// Other systems can listen for these events
const events = world.getEvents('enemy_killed');
```

### ECS Architecture vs. Eidolon

- **Modularity**: Components and systems are independent and reusable
- **Performance**: Only relevant systems process relevant entities
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new entity types and behaviors
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of data and logic
- **Memory Efficiency**: Object pooling prevents garbage collection spikes
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with component type checking
